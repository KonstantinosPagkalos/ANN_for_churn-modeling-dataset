# ANN_for_churn-modeling-dataset
This dataset appears to be related to customer information from a bank, likely used for predicting customer churn (whether a customer will leave the bank).
Each row represents a customer, and the columns provide various details about the customer.
The "Exited" column is the target variable, which indicates whether a customer has left the bank. 
This dataset can be used to build models to predict customer churn based on features like credit score, age, geography, balance, and whether they are active members, among others.
this project has an Artificial Neural Network that can make predictions according to this dataset
the project has been built with Python
